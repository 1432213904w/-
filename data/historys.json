CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.\n\nIf the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately.\n\nIf the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've defined – such as an Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaPackage channel, or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.\nAs an example, suppose that you're serving an image from a traditional web server, not from CloudFront. For example, you might serve an image, sunsetphoto.png, using the URL\nhttp://example.com/sunsetphoto.png.\nYour users can easily navigate to this URL and see the image. But they probably don't know that their request was routed from one network to another – through the complex collection of interconnected networks that comprise the internet – until the image was found.\n\nCloudFront speeds up the distribution of your content by routing each user request through the AWS backbone network to the edge location that can best serve your content. Typically, this is a CloudFront edge server that provides the fastest delivery to the viewer. Using the AWS network dramatically reduces the number of networks that your users' requests must pass through, which improves performance. Users get lower latency – the time it takes to load the first byte of the file – and higher data transfer rates.\n\nYou also get increased reliability and availability because copies of your files (also known as objects) are now held (or cached) in multiple edge locations around the world.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html","options":[{"code":"A","content":"Redesign the application to use Amazon CloudFront.","selected":false,"value":1.0},{"code":"B","content":"Redesign the application to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk.","selected":false,"value":0.0},{"code":"C","content":"Redesign the application to use a Network Load Balancer.","selected":false,"value":0.0},{"code":"D","content":"Redesign the application to use Amazon S3 static website hosting.","selected":false,"value":0.0}],"title":"A company hosts its product information webpages on AWS.

AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume – there is no charge when your code is not running. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service – all with zero administration. AWS Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. All you need to do is\nsupply your code in one of the languages that AWS Lambda supports.\n\nStoring your static content with S3 provides a lot of advantages. But to help optimize your application’s performance and security while effectively managing cost, we recommend that you also set up Amazon CloudFront to work with your S3 bucket to serve and protect the content.

MFA. Delete only works for CLI or API interaction, not in the AWS Management Console. Also, you cannot make version DELETE actions with MFA using IAM user credentials. You must use your root AWS account.\n\nObject Versioning\n\nUse Amazon S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in one bucket. For example, you could store my-image.jpg (version 111111) and my-image.jpg (version 222222) in a single bucket. S3 Versioning protects you from the consequences of unintended overwrites and deletions. You can also use it to archive objects so that you have access to previous versions.\nYou must explicitly enable S3 Versioning on your bucket. By default, S3 Versioning is disabled. Regardless of whether you have enabled Versioning, each object in your bucket has a version ID. If you have not enabled Versioning, Amazon S3 sets the value of the version ID to null. If S3 Versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 assigns a version ID value for the object. This value distinguishes it from other versions of the same key. \n\nReference:\nhttps://books.google.com.sg/books?id=wv45DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=hosts+a+static+website+within+an+Amazon+S3+bucket.+A+solutions+architect+needs+to+ensure+that+data+can+be+recovered+in+case+of+accidental+deletion&source=bl&ots=0NolP5igY5&sig=ACfU3U3opL9Jha6jM2EI8x7EcjK4rigQHQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS9e3yy7vpAhVx73MBHZNoDnQQ6AEwAHoECBQQAQ#v=onepage&q=hosts%20a%20static%20website%20within%20an%20Amazon%20S3%20bucket.%20A%20solutions%20architect%20needs%20to%20ensure%20that%20data%20can%20be%20recovered%20in%20case%20of%20accidental%20deletion&f=false\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securing-access-to-aws-using-mfa-part-3/\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html","index":5.0,"selected":false,"typecode":"01","_id":"20201006004098","answer":"A"},{"options":[{"code":"A","content":"Deploy a NAT Instance in a private subnet of each Availability Zone.","selected":false,"value":0.0},{"value":1.0,"code":"B","content":"Deploy a NAT gateway in a public subnet of each Availability Zone.","selected":false},{"code":"C","content":"Deploy a transit gateway in a private subnet of each Availability Zone.","selected":false,"value":0.0},{"code":"D","content":"Deploy an internet gateway in a public subnet of each Availability Zone.","selected":false,"value":0.0}],"selected":false,"title":"A company runs an application on Amazon EC2 Instances.

Regardless of whether you have enabled Versioning, each object in your bucket has a version ID. If you have not enabled Versioning, Amazon S3 sets the value of the version ID to null. If S3 Versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 assigns a version ID value for the object. This value distinguishes it from other versions of the same key. \n\nReference:\nhttps://books.google.com.sg/books?id=wv45DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=hosts+a+static+website+within+an+Amazon+S3+bucket.+A+solutions+architect+needs+to+ensure+that+data+can+be+recovered+in+case+of+accidental+deletion&source=bl&ots=0NolP5igY5&sig=ACfU3U3opL9Jha6jM2EI8x7EcjK4rigQHQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS9e3yy7vpAhVx73MBHZNoDnQQ6AEwAHoECBQQAQ#v=onepage&q=hosts%20a%20static%20website%20within%20an%20Amazon%20S3%20bucket.%20A%20solutions%20architect%20needs%20to%20ensure%20that%20data%20can%20be%20recovered%20in%20case%20of%20accidental%20deletion&f=false\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securing-access-to-aws-using-mfa-part-3/\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html","index":5.0,"options":[{"value":1.0,"code":"A","content":"Enable Amazon S3 versioning.","selected":false},{"code":"B","content":"Enable Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering.","selected":false,"value":0.0},{"code":"C","content":"Enable an Amazon S3 lifecycle policy.","selected":false,"value":0.0},{"code":"D","content":"Enable Amazon S3 cross-Region replication.","selected":true,"val":0.0,"value":0.0}],"_id":"20201006004098","category":"004","right":false,"typecode":"01"},{"title":"A company is reviewing its AWS Cloud deployment to ensure its data is not accessed by anyone without appropriate authorization.
